# locatarr - Why? 
My intent is to locate all the *arr apps that are out there in the world, like Sonarr, Radarr, etc. Thus, locatarr! 

These services are generally all tied to some form of media and aid the end user by automating and managing downloads, file renaming, etc. 

# Services 
Not all inclusive -- please feel free to update as you see fit! 

All services are supported on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Docker unless otherwise noted.
